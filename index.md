# Special Topics in Materials Engineering

### Second semester 2016

Andrés Marrugo, PhD   
Jairo Useche, PhD   
*Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar*

Invited lecturers: 

- Marcelo Pagnola, Universidad de Buenos Aires (Argentina)
- Marcin Górski, Silesian Technical University (Poland)

##  Aims and Scope

This module is an introduction to optical techniques for shape and deformation measurements. It is aimed at graduate students in the Faculty of Engineering. We will focus on the practical and theoretical aspects of optical metrology in experimental mechanics.

At the end of the lectures, one would be able to:

- Have clear idea of challenges in optical metrology for shape and deformation measurements.
- Understand many different optical metrology techniques.
- Implement several image processing algorithms for optical measurements.
 


## Useful Resources

Several of the techniques that we will study are to be implemented in MATLAB. Please follow the tutorials and get acquainted with the programing environement.

## Outline

This is a new course, this website will be updated as we go along.

### Lecture 1: Introduction

We will be discussing the main aspects and motivation for optical techniques in experimental mechanics. A brief discussion on accuracy and precision related to uncertainty in physical measurements.

### Lecture 2: Basic Optical Principles and Imaging Systems

We will be studying the basic optical principles, the nature of light, light as a wave, polarization, wavefront propagation, and image formation with lenses.
