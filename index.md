# Special Topics in Materials Engineering

### Second semester 2016

Andrés Marrugo, PhD
*Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar*

##  Aims and Scope

This module is an introduction to optical techniques for shape and deformation measurements. It is aimed at graduate students in the Faculty of Engineering. We will focus on the practical and theoretical aspects of optical metrology in experimental mechanics.

At the end of the lectures, one would be able to:

- Have clear idea of challenges in optical metrology for shape and deformation measurements.
- Understand many different optical metrology techniques.
- Implement several image processing algorithms for optical measurements.
 


## Useful Resources

Several of the techniques that we will study are to be implemented in MATLAB. Please follow the tutorials and get acquainted with the programing environement.
